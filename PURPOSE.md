# Resonance: Real-Time Collaborative Consensus Building

## What It Is

Resonance is a collaborative decision-making tool that helps groups discover what they unanimously agree on. It's designed for synchronous group sessions where participants work together in real-time to find common ground.

## The Core Process

**1. Collective Statement Queuing**
- Any participant can submit statements (opinions, proposals, observations)
- All active participants must vote on each statement before the next one appears
- Statements are queued and presented one at a time to maintain focus

**2. Fair Rotation**
- The system uses a fairness algorithm to decide which statement gets voted on next
- People who have had fewer statements resolved get priority
- This prevents any single person from dominating the conversation

**3. Binary Voting**
- For each live statement, participants vote: Agree or Disagree
- No abstaining, no neutral positions—the format demands clarity
- Statement creators automatically vote "agree" on their own statements

**4. Emergent Consensus Display**
- Statements where everyone unanimously agrees are extracted and displayed together
- These agreed statements flow together as a continuous text, forming an emergent shared narrative
- This creates a real-time visualization of the group's collective agreement

## The Intended Experience

**Conversational Flow**: The app creates a structured dialogue where the group processes ideas sequentially rather than simultaneously, reducing chaos while maintaining spontaneity.

**Discovery Over Debate**: Rather than arguing, the group discovers alignment. Disagreement simply means a statement doesn't make it into the shared narrative—there's no winner or loser.

**Living Document**: The flowing text of agreed statements grows organically during the session, forming a living record of consensus that participants create together in real-time.

**Ephemeral Sessions**: Sessions exist only while people are connected. No accounts, no permanent storage, no residue. This encourages presence and participation in the moment.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Meeting Facilitation**: Finding common ground before diving into contentious details
- **Workshop Activities**: Collaborative visioning or value alignment exercises
- **Social Gatherings**: Party games or ice-breakers that reveal group dynamics
- **Brainstorming**: Filtering a stream of ideas down to those with universal support
- **Team Building**: Creating shared mission statements or team agreements
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identifying areas of agreement before addressing disagreements

## Key Characteristics

- **Synchronous**: Designed for groups present at the same time
- **Anonymous**: No authentication—participants are identified only by temporary IDs
- **Focused**: Only one statement is "live" at a time, demanding group attention
- **Fair**: Algorithm ensures balanced participation
- **Immediate**: Real-time feedback and visualization
- **Graceful**: Handles reconnections and temporary disconnections smoothly
- **Minimal**: No complexity beyond the core voting mechanism

## The Philosophical Intent

Resonance operates on the principle that finding what a group agrees on is more valuable than cataloging disagreements. By forcing sequential processing and demanding unanimous agreement, it creates a space where consensus emerges naturally rather than being forced through compromise or majority rule.
